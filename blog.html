        is the super friendly mountain city that is waiting for you to visit them.When you arrive here, either by bus or
        plane, you’ll be greeted by the most spectacular panoramic views of snow-capped mountains, ancient palaces and
        Buddhist stupas.
        It’s also a welcome paradise from the busy, dirty cities like Delhi and Rajasthan. Here’s the ultimate Leh
        Ladakh travel guide including how to reach Leh, top things to do, where to stay and what to eat!

            Leh Ladakh has an interesting mix of cultures and food as it’s on the border of China and its history is
            closely related to Tibet! You’ll probably question what country you’re in a lot while you’re here and that’s
            the beauty of Leh. The best time to visit is actually in the monsoon season between June – September as
            Ladakh
            is a dry spot in a country of constant rain! They also shut the road after mid-September so it’s best to
            visit before then or fly! <br> <br>
            It’s beautifully sunny every single day at this time and everything almost looks saturated as you’re closer
            to the sun and higher up at 3,500 metres! It’s also perfect weather for trekking and is what most travellers
            flock here for.

            the beauty of Leh. <br>
            There are usually two choices for approaching Leh Ladakh. You can directly fly to Leh Ladakh from Delhi
            which is what most travellers prefer as you can skip the long bus journeys up through the Indian states of
            Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. But, this means that you cannot acclimatise very easily and you may
            suffer from altitude sickness and need a few days to adjust. <br> <br>
